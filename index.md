## Recruiting

**Recruiting Ph.D. students and Research Interns. Either onsite or remotely is fine.**<br>

## Research Areas

- Controllable and Trustworthy Large Language Models (2023–Now)  
  - Controllable generation (Diffusion/Alignment, Context-DPO, Divide-and-Conquer).  
  - Faithfulness and safety (context fidelity, hallucination mitigation, adversarial robustness, watermarking, jailbreak defense).  
  - Bias and fairness (entity bias, multilingual bias, input vulnerability).  

- Reasoning-Centric Multi-Modal Agents (2024–Now)  
  - Reasoning and fusion across modalities (vision, language, structured data).  
  - Knowledge graph-based explainable reasoning.  
  - Tool use and task-driven agents.  

- Efficient and Robust Graph & Spatio-Temporal Learning (2018–2022)  
  - Data-efficient graph learning (IGNN, EIGNN, GraphCrop, etc.).  
  - Robust graph learning and adversarial defense.  
  - Temporal graphs and urban computing (time-aware neighbor sampling, traffic prediction, dynamic modeling).  

- Human Motion and Behavior Understanding (2018–Now)  
  - 3D human/hand pose estimation and generative modeling (VAE, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting).  
  - Action recognition and prediction (graph-based modeling, LLMs for action recognition).  
  - Applications in AR/VR and human-computer interaction.
