The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been transformed by massive
pre-trained language models.  They form the basis of all state-of-the-art
systems across a wide range of tasks and have shown an impressive ability to
generate fluent text and perform few-shot learning.  At the same time, these
models are hard to understand and give rise to new ethical and scalability
challenges.  In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the
modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as
well as gain hands-on experience working with them.
