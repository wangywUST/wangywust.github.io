# EECS 224: Large Language Models

This is a new course of UC Merced starting at Spring 2025. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them.

## The Goal of This Course

Offering useful, fundemental, detailed LLM knowledge to students.

## Coursework

1. In-Course Question Answering
2. Final Projects

### In-Course Question Answering

In each class, students will be asked several questions. Each student can only answer each question one time. The student who correctly answers a question for the first time and explain the answer clearly to all the classmates will be granted 1 credit. The final scores will be calculated based on the accumulated credits throughout the whole semester. This score does not contribute to the final grading. In the final course, the students who get high scores in question answering will be highlighted as a reputation.

### Final Projects

Every student should complete a final project related to LLMs and present it in the final classes. A project report should be completed before the presentation and submitted to [Final Project Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1foBTff-e2GpbRGu97B125TFwSLKJX54l?usp=sharing) The file should be named as "Your Name.pdf" The format should follow the [2025 ACL long paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Good examples are at [Project Report Examples](https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2024/#2024acl-long)

The final project scores will be calculated through 70% Instructor's rating + 30% Classmates' rating. After all the presentations, every student will be asked to choose 3 best projects. The classmates' ratings will be based on the ratings of all the classmates.
