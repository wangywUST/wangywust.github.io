## EECS 224: Large Language Models

This is a new course of UC Merced starting at Spring 2025. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of large language models, as well as gain hands-on experience working with them.

## The Goal of This Course

Offering useful, fundemental, detailed LLM knowledge to students.

## Coursework

Your grade is based on two activities:

1. In-Course Question Answering (50%)
2. Final Projects (50%)

### In-Course Question Answering

In each class, the students will be asked several questions. Every student can only answer every question for one time. The student who correctly answer the question for the first time will be granted 1 credit. The final scores will be calculated based on the accumulated credits in the whole semester.

### Final Projects

Every student should complete a final project related to LLMs and present it in the final classes.
