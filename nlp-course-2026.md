## Coursework

1. In-Course Question Answering
2. Final Projects

### In-Course Question Answering

In each class, students will be asked several questions. Each student can only answer each question one time. The student who correctly answers a question for the first time and explain the answer clearly to all the classmates will be granted 1 credit. The final scores will be calculated based on the accumulated credits throughout the whole semester. This score does not contribute to the final grading. In the final course, the students who get high scores in question answering will be highlighted as a reputation.

### Final Projects

Every student should complete a final project related to LLMs and present it in the final classes. A project report should be completed before the presentation and submitted to [Final Project Google Form](TBD) The file should be named as "Your Name.pdf" The format should follow the [2025 ACL long paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Good examples are at [Project Report Examples](https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2024/#2024acl-long)

The final project scores will be calculated through 50% Instructor's rating + 50% TAs' rating.
