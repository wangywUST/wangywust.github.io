## Staff Members

## Course Modality

Either onsite or virtual attendance is acceptable. Regardless of whether you attend lectures in person, you are required to join the course using the [Zoom link](https://ucmerced.zoom.us/my/ucmnlp). This is necessary for participating in the in-course question answering.

## Coursework

1. In-Course Question Answering
2. Final Projects

### In-Course Question Answering

In each class, students will be asked several questions. Each student may answer each question only once. The student who correctly answers a question first and explains the answer clearly to the class will be granted 1 credit. Final scores will be calculated based on accumulated credits throughout the semester. This score does not contribute to the final grade. At the end of the course, students who achieve high scores in question answering will be highlighted for recognition.

The timestamp for in-course question answering is determined by the message time in the Zoom chat. The main content of your answer should be conveyed in your Zoom chat message.

### Final Projects

Every student should complete a final project related to LLMs and present it in the final classes. A project report should be completed before the presentation and submitted to [Final Project Google Form](TBD) The file should be named as "Your Name.pdf" The format should follow the [2025 ACL long paper template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Good examples are at [Project Report Examples](https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2024/#2024acl-long)

The final project scores will be calculated through 50% Instructor's rating + 50% TAs' rating.
