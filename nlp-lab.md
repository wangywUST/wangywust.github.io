**UC Merced is close to the Yosemite National Park and Silicon Valley, both of which require only 2 hours' driving. Such a distance allows the flexible internship during learning. Our lab absolutely supports all the research internships even at the beginning of Ph.D. study. Also, the advisors will utilize our own connections to help the students find the internship and job chances.**

Our connections include but are not limited to the following organizations:



## Research Aim

At the UC Merced NLP Lab, we envision a future where large language model based AI systems converge to create trustworthy intelligent assistants to serve humans in all important scenarios, e.g., education, healthcare, creative work. 
Our mission is to pioneer transformative technologies at this intersection, developing next-generation AI systems that are both technologically advanced and human-centric, ultimately building the foundation for a mutual trusted, intelligent world.
Our research focuses on large foundation models based trustworthy natural language processing and its applications as AI assistants. Our research considers not only textual but also vision data, with the target of understanding ubiquitos multi-modal data in real-world applications.
